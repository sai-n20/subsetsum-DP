# subsetsum-DP
Programming assignment for CS401 to extract various information from a subset sum implementation using Dynamic Programming

# Compilation instructions
Usage of my implementation is like this:
ssum <TARGET> < <INPUT-FILE>
The cmd-line argument is the target sum itself.
The program reads the elements a[1]...a[N] from std-input, to which a file will be specified to read from.
The file reading procedure has been left unchanged from what was provided to start off.
